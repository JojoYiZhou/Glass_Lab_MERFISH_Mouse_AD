# Transcriptional circuitry underlying neuropathology-associated microglia phenotypes 
## Molecular signatures and spatial organisation of AD-pathology-associated microglia under different conditions

## Description:
## In this repository, we show how to analyze MERFISH (MERSCOPE/VIZGEN) datasets on  the brain samples of AD-pathology mouse models. Additionally, we provide our data processing pipelines to reproduce the figures for our submitted 2024 manuscript.
